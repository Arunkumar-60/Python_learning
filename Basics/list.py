# list : list is a collection of different data types values. []
# ex: l= [1,2.34, "arun" , "g" , *+90j, 78]

# float takes 8 bites of storage
# indexing : retrieves single value of the sequence

# indexes starts from 0-n-1
# slicing: retrieves a part / piece of sequence

l= [1,2.34, "arun" , "g" , 8+90j, 78]
print (l)
    
print (l[0:1]) 
# retieves single split

# we can change value in the list ex:
    
l[2]=625

print (l)

# tupiles is a collection of data , same as list , but cant be changes like list, immuttable obeject
# ex:l=(12,234.3,"helllo",3+8j)
