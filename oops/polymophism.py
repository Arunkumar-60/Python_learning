# polymorphism :
#     poly means many and morphs means forms 

    # compile Time -> method overlading  , constructor overloading (same class same method )
    # (not possible in python as we can compile level in python or we cant define data types)
    # python is interpretor language 

    # run time -> overridding (diff class same method)
